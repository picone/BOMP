    Program ........ Cacti Aggregate Builder
    Version ........ 0.70 B2
    Purpose ........ Build Aggregate Graphs from existing ones

*******************************************************************************/


----[ Purpose

    This plugin aggregates graphs from Graph Management.
    All data you want to see must already be present on any existing graphs.

----[ Features

    1) Aggregates existing Graphs into a single Aggregate Graph, keeping the sequence
       of selected Graphs and of the Graph Items within theses Graphs.
    2) Provides a new Graph Title for the Aggregate.
    3) Prepends all legend items with an optional text.
    4) Provides an algorithm to add additional <HR> linebreaks.
       This prevents ugly formatting.
    5) Allows for converting into AREA/STACK or LINE1 graphs
    6) Displays a list of Graph Items (taken from the first Graph selected) to allow
       for skipping selected graph items
    7) Allows for Totaling, either SIMILAR or ALL data sources
    8) Defines "Color Templates". These define a list of colors, e.g. light red to dark
       red. Allows to associate colored Graph Items to a Color Template. By doing so,
       Graph Items of same data source will no longer show the same color but instead
       will be colorized according to the Color Template

----[ Prerequisites

    Before you install Aggregate, you need to have met the following pre-requisites:

    1) Cacti 0.8.6i or Above.  Versions of Cacti prior to 0.8.6 are not supported.
    2) Cacti 0.8.6x versions requires Plugin Architecture V1.1.
       Please change ./include/config.php to add this plugin as usual
    3) Cacti 0.8.7x requires Plugin Architecture V2.x.
       Please change ./include/global.php to add this plugin as usual
       Please use the Plugin Management to enable the plugin

----[ Installation

    Install is similar to other plugins. Please refer to the documentation of
    Plugin Architecture, as PIA V2.x handles installation in a different way.

    Realm ID is 72 for Cacti 0.8.6, needed to _manage_ Color Templates. Using Color 
    Templates is possible without access to this realm id.
    Using the Aggregate function is granted to all users havin Console access.

----[ Usage

    Please see attached aggregate_manual.pdf.
    The manual is linked the the aggregate prompt screen.

----[ Additional Help?

    If you need additional help, please goto forums.cacti.net.

----[ Possible Bugs?

    If you figure out this problem, let me know!!!

----[ Special Thanks

	The idea to create such a plugin was first mentioned by TheWitness, even if he
	preferred to work on Data Sources instead of Graphs.

----[ Future Changes

	When totaling, don't show legend items, on user request

----[ Changelog
    --- SVN ---

    --- 0.70 ---
	Feature: Support for Totalling, either for _similar_ or _all_ data sources
			 This feature will automatically create any needed CDEF by replacing
			 CURRENT_DATA_SOURCE by either
			 SIMILAR_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS or
			 ALL_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS
			 But it first searches for any existing CDEF that matches!
			 Those autocreated CDEFs will be named
			 AGGREGATE SIMILAR <old CDEF name> or
			 AGGREGATE ALL <old CDEF name>
	Feature: Allow for all |host_*| variables in AGGREGATE graph items
	Feature: remove unwanted |query_*| and |host_*| stuff from graph titles, 
			 not making sense on AGGREGATES, e.g.
			 Aggregate |host_description| - Traffic - |query_ifName|
			 will turn to
			 Aggregate - Traffic
			 This will be displayed before graph is created.
	Feature: Do not ask for <HR> settings, compute them!
			 If an item with <HR> is skipped, set <HR> on previous item
			 Always set <HR> on last item of graph, so next graph starts "fresh"
	Bug Fix: "Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated"
			 is a PHP5 compatibility issue
			 Error Handler was changed to cope with this
	Bug Fix: Cleanup of code for creating the main graph structures
	Bug Fix: If Graphs based on different Graph Templates are used, drop an error
			 e.g. aggregating
			 - standard traffic
			 - 95th percentile
			 - bandwidth traffic
			 will result in weird graphs. We will dop an error here,
			 advising, that a single graph template is required for aggregation
			 (To complete error handling, graphs.php needs a change)
	Tweak:	 Split up setup.php code. It contains plugin stuff only, now
			 Aggregate functions have been moved to aggregate.php
	Tweak:	 Input Field Validation reworked
	Tweak:	 Form Layout now matches standard Cacti Form Layout

    --- 0.66 ---
    Tweak:	 Cleanup of README
	Bug fix: Support issues with PIA2.1 fixed. Compatibility with 086j is still maintained

    --- 0.65 ---
    Tweak:	 Code cleanup, mostly commented stuff removed
    Feature: New "GPRINT Prefix", defaults to |host_hostname| to mimic previous behaviour
    Feature: PIA 2.0/Cacti 087 support
	Bug fix: Do not specify a default character set for tables.  latin1 is not
	universal

    --- 0.64 ---
    Bug fix: Escape cacti database names using strange characters (StephenKing)

    --- 0.63 ---
    Bug fix: Color is associated even if not using a color template
	Feature: Required tables are auto-created

    --- 0.62 ---
	Bug fix: Initialization issues

    --- 0.61 ---
	Bug fix: Error, when deleting a Color Template
	Tweak:   include statements use $config path variables

    --- 0.6 ---
    Added checkboxes for <HR>. On specific Graph Templates, it will not be possible
    to compute all needed <HR>s. So we prompt you to set them manually.
    bug: LINEx graphs converted to AREA/STACK will now have AREA on the first graph items

    --- 0.5 ---
    Managing of Color Templates
    Referring to Color Templates allows for different colors for same data source

    --- 0.4 ---
    Add skipping of selected Graph Items

    --- 0.3 ---
    Add Graph Type Conversion

    --- 0.2 ---
    First public release, very basic functions
