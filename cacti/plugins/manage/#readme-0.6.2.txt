----[ Purpose

    This plugin allows you to automatically view your network by checking :
	- TCP Ports
	- Processes
	- Services
	
    Up, down and reboot events :
	- can be immediatly sent to you by email, "net send", syslog/NT event viewer or SNMP trap
	- are logged and available in Event Reporting


----[ Features

    Monitor TCP ports, windows services and processes for multiple hosts.
    Multiples views.
    You can associate an image with your host.
    Use his own groups or those from Tree.
    You can display only hosts in error.
    Use AJAX.
    Use overlib to display graphs.
    Blink hostnames when a threshold is breaked.
    Use tresholds.
    You can set cycle time delay between groups.
    The time until the next graph change is displayed.
    You can click objects to access Reporting.
	Let you open remote shell for each TCP port.
    Guest account can only view tab manage, not Reporting.
    You can choose between the default Cacti output or force SNMP, WMI (Vbs or Perl).
    You can make themes for images.
    Alerts by sound, mail, poput, syslog or SNMP trap.
    Use the plugin Update for checking updates.
	Daily report.

----[ Installation

    Read #INSTALL.txt.
    

----[ Bugs
   
    SNMP agent for Win32 is not perfect, so WMI is better.
    The Cacti poller only use first 155 caracters for the oid.
    When you first log on manage tab (without user settings set), apply your settings.
    Text alignement in tree view.
